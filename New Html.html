	<h4><font face="arial"><p style=text-align:justify;>Muhammad Ali Jinnah, also known as Quaid-e-Azam, was the founder and first Governor General of Pakistan. He was born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi. Jinnah served as the leader of the All India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on August 14, 1947. He then served as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum, "Father of the Nation". His birthday is a national holiday in Pakistan.</p>
	<p style=text-align:justify;>Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu-Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All India Muslim League. However, he became disillusioned with politics after a legal battle with Gopal Krishna Gokhale, his political mentor, regarding the issue of self-government. He went to London in 1930 and returned to India to reorganize the Muslim league again in 1934. Jinnah embraced the goal of creating a separate state for Muslims as per the Lahore resolution. The League won most reserved Muslim seats in the elections of 1946. After a failed bid to form a coalition with the Congress, he helped lead a successful demand for the partition of India.</p>
	<p style=text-align:justify;>Jinnah’s tireless efforts, indomitable will, and dauntless courage led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947. Despite facing numerous challenges and opposition, Jinnah never compromised on his principles and vision. His vision for Pakistan was based on the principles of social justice, brotherhood, and equality. He envisioned Pakistan as a democratic and progressive state with an emphasis on the rule of law and education for all.</p>
	<p style=text-align:justify;>Jinnah’s charismatic leadership inspired millions of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. His powerful advocacy for the Two-Nation theory won him the support of Muslims across India and led to the creation of a separate Muslim state, Pakistan. His unwavering commitment to his cause, his eloquent public speaking, and his strong sense of justice continue to inspire millions around the world.</p>
	<p style=text-align:justify;>Despite his failing health, Jinnah worked tirelessly to establish the foundations of the Pakistani state and its government. He passed away on September 11, 1948, just a little over a year after Pakistan came into existence.
